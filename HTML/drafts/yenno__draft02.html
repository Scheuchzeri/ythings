                        especially those things that are most self-evident. 
                        why does this monitor exist? where did this metal-bar
                        we use to secure ourselves in the metro come from?
                        what is its history? and to realize that in pursuing
                        these seeminlgy futile questions is, in fact, self-empowering."
